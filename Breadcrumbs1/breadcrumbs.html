        <h2>SENIOR DESIGN SEMINAR</h2>



        <p>Students work on self-defined, typically communication-oriented, projects over the course of one and in rare cases two semesters. They work with the instructor to clarify objectives, develop or assemble content, and design and produce a body of work that demonstrates facility with appropriate tools and techniques, high craft values, awareness of relevant contexts, and evidence of aesthetic judgment. Students meet as a group to discuss their work with peers, the course instructor and professional guests. The studio emphasis of the course is underpinned by one-on-one and group crits and discussion; panel review sessions involving other design instructors and guest critics; and a public exhibition of completed work. It may be complemented by assigned readings, seminar presentations and discussions, and writing exercises. The discussion component emphasizes contemporary design and communication practice in the print and digital realms, and in various professional and public contexts. Course may be repeated once for credit. Graphic Design concentrators will ordinarily have completed most if not all of their other studio requirements prior to taking Design Seminar. They have the option of taking two studio courses in lieu of a second semester of Seminar. Concentrators in Book Arts and other areas for which Design Seminar is a capstone option are expected to declare their intention to enter Design Seminar at the time they declare their concentration. Book Arts concentrators will ordinarily have completed most if not all of their other studio requirements prior to taking Design Seminar. Design Seminar may be taken as a studio elective by any student who applies and is accepted on the basis of her or his proposal, and evidence of a mature body of work.
